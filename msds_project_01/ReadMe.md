## MSDS6301 Case Study 1!!!

### Description

The Beers dataset contains a list of 2410 US craft beers and Breweries dataset contains 558 US breweries.<br>
The datasets descriptions are as follows.

**Beers.csv:**

|**Field Name** | **Description**                          |
|-------------|:-------------------------------------------|
|Name         | Name of the beer                           |
|Beer_ID      | Unique identifier of the beer              |
|ABV          | Alcohol by volume of the beer              |
|IBU          | International Bitterness Units of the beer |
|Brewery_ID   | Brewery id associated with the beer        |  
|Style        | Style of the beer                          |
|Ounces       | Ounces of beer                             |

**Breweries.csv:**


|**Field Name** | **Description**                          |
|---------------|:-----------------------------------------|
|Brew_ID        | Unique identifier of the brewery.        |  
|Name           | Name of the brewery.                     |
|City           | City where the brewery is located.       |
|State          | U.S. State where the brewery is located. |

Analyze both datasets to answer following questions:

1.  How many breweries are present in each state?
2.  Plot a bar chart with median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. 
3.  Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
4.  Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
5.  Relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.
6.  Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and 
    other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  
    Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. 
7.  Knock their socks off! Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in.  
    You must convince them why it is important and back up your conviction with appropriate statistical evidence.
